<p><strong>*This project is now deprecated and has moved to a private repository*</strong></p>
<p></p>

<p>Project_photo_tool aka <a href='www.rinsr.tools'>rinsr.tools<a> is a web application that includes client-side tools written in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Every .jpg file contains underlying data about the file: the format, the device it was taken on, and even the GPS location of the photo.
This is called <strong><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>exif data<a></strong> (Exchangeable image file format).
When it comes to other files, howver, this is called <strong><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>metadata<a></strong>.
if you upload that photo to the internet, anybody could potentially view this hidden data. Some websites remove this data by 
default upon upload, but you may not always be sure if it does or doesn't.</p>
<p>By using rinsr.tools, you can be sure to know exactly what type of data is contained in your files! We store zero data! Your privacy is valued by using rinsr.tools. Thank you for checking it out! ☺️</p>

<h2>Exif Photo Tool</h2>

<p>Exif Photo Tool is a client-side tool that can output the exif data of any photo you upload. To get the exif data, just drag your photo or click in the box that says "Drop your files here". Currently the app will only allow you to view the exif data. In the future, I will make updates to expand functionality including the option to save the data to a .txt file and also include the option to remove the exif data of the photo.</p>

<h2>Dot Method Generator</h2>

<p>The Dot Method Generator is another JavaScript-based tool that will take your email and generate all possible iterations of your email while utilizing Google's dot method trick. You also have the option to save the output as a .txt file for your own scripts. If you don't know what the dot method is, please read on. If you own a Gmail account, you can put a period in between any character in the email username which will result in a new email that routs to your original email. This can be helpful if you want to create a catchall that routs to your main Gmail.</p>
